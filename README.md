### Why hello there wonderful reader!

My name is Matt, or as most people know me on the internet, RubyNova. I am a massive advocate for .NET, C#, and C++ as my friends would probably attest to by the fact I talk about it almost all the time. As such, its probably no surprise that I happen to own the C# Discord that is linked to by the .NET Foundation itself.

I also absolutely love games development, graphics/rendering programming especially. So much so that I got the insane idea to write my own game engine with a few friends. It's easily the project I am most passionate about, and have sunk the most time into. The game engine, NovelRT, is probably my most creative outlet, and I am hoping long-term it will become really viable as FOSS.

I happen to spend much of my time in the Unity game engine as well, either for work or for game jams (Ludum Dare is great fun!). It was certainly an interesting transition when taking my BSc. Hons. in Games Design & Development from regular .NET and C#, but definitely a transition I am happy I made! It was what originally got me into graphics programming, with the exposure to shader programming, particle systems, lighting, etc.

Please, feel free to look around my sea of repositories (and at my game engine, pretty please? There's cookies in it for you I swear!). The repositories I'm most proud of are pinned to my profile, so that probably should help with "what I'm most proud of" so to speak.

Have fun!
